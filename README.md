Small test Project built in Unity 2021 LTS. When Running this on the Holo Table, one of the glasses does not display the scene correctly (One half of the table is rendered as two side by side images instead of one 3D image).
Which pair of glasses and which half of the table is rendered incorrectly seems to be random.
